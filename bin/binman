BINMAN 1 "2011-12-06" "2.0.0"
=============================

NAME
----

binman - UNIX man pages for Ruby `bin/` scripts

SYNOPSIS
--------

`binman` [*OPTION*]... *COMMAND*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

[binman] produces UNIX man pages for your Ruby `bin/` scripts.  It can extract
their leading comment headers (defined below), convert them from markdown(7)
into roff(7) using [md2man] and [Redcarpet2], and display them using man(1).

### Leading Comment Headers

A leading comment header can be one of the following two things:

1. A contiguous sequence of single-line comments starting at the
   beginning of the file (after shebang and encoding comments plus
   optional blank lines) and ending at the first single blank line.

2. First embedded document delimited by `=begin` and `=end` lines.

### Markdown Processing Divergence

Although your leading comment headers are written in markdown(7), `binman
conv` introduces the following additions to markdown(7) syntax via [md2man]:

  * There can be at most one top-level heading (H1).  It is emitted as `.TH`
    in the roff(7) output, specifying the UNIX man page's header and footer.

  * Paragraphs whose lines are all uniformly indented by two spaces are
    considered to be "indented paragraphs".  They are unindented accordingly
    before emission as `.IP` in the roff(7) output.

  * Paragraphs whose subsequent lines (all except the first) are uniformly
    indented by two spaces are considered to be a "tagged paragraphs".  They
    are unindented accordingly before emission as `.TP` in the roff(7) output.

### Markdown Processing Extensions

The following [Redcarpet2] extensions for markdown(7) are enabled:

* tables
* autolink
* superscript
* strikethrough
* no_intra_emphasis
* fenced_code_blocks

OPTIONS
-------

`-h`, `--help`
  Display this help manual using man(1).
