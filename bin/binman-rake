## NAME

binman-rake - run rake(1) tasks from binman(1)

## SYNOPSIS

`binman-rake` [*OPTION*]... [*TASK*]...

This program lets you run rake(1) tasks provided by binman(1) without having
to create a special file named `Rakefile` that contains the following snippet:

  It also runs the `md2man:man` task, provided by md2man-rake(1), which
  builds UNIX manual pages from `*.markdown`, `*.mkd`, and `*.md` files
  found in or beneath the `man/` subdirectory in your working directory.

`binman:web`
  Builds HTML manual pages from scripts found in your `bin/` directory.
  It also runs the `md2man:web` task, provided by md2man-rake(1), which
  builds HTML manual pages from `*.markdown`, `*.mkd`, and `*.md` files
  found in or beneath the `man/` subdirectory in your working directory.
